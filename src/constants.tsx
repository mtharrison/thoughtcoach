    event:
      "I was walking down the street on a sunny day when suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my ankle. As I looked down, I realized that I had stepped on a broken piece of glass that was now embedded in my foot. I hobbled over to a nearby bench and tried to pull the glass out, but it was too deep. I had to call a friend to come pick me up and take me to the hospital, where I had to undergo a painful procedure to have the glass removed. The incident left me with a limp for several days and a fear of walking barefoot in public places.",
    thought:
      "I can't believe this happened to me. I must be so clumsy and stupid for not watching where I was going. This is just like me to ruin a perfectly good day with my own carelessness.",
